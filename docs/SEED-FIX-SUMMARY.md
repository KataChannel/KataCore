# 🔧 Fixed: Shared Prisma Seed Issues

## 📋 Issue Summary
The `bun run prisma:seed` command was not working due to missing dependencies and configuration issues in the shared Prisma setup.

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Shared Package.json Dependencies
Added missing dependencies to `/shared/package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@prisma/client": "^6.11.1",
    "prisma": "^6.11.1",
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/bcrypt": "^5.0.2",
    "tsx": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed Seed Script Path
Updated the seed script in `/shared/package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:seed": "tsx prisma/seed/hrm-seed.ts"
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated Root Package.json Script
Fixed the root `prisma:seed` script in `/package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prisma:seed": "cd shared && npm run db:seed"
  }
}
```

### 4. Generated Prisma Client
Ensured the Prisma client is properly generated in the shared directory:

```bash
cd shared && npx prisma generate
```

## ✅ Working Commands

Now these commands work correctly:

```bash
# From root directory
npm run prisma:seed
bun run prisma:seed

# From shared directory
npm run db:seed
npx tsx prisma/seed/hrm-seed.ts
```

## 🎯 Seed Results

The HRM seed script successfully creates:

- **3 Roles**: HR_MANAGER, DEPARTMENT_MANAGER, EMPLOYEE
- **7 Users**: Including managers and employees with proper role assignments
- **3 Departments**: Human Resources, IT, Sales
- **6 Positions**: Various positions across departments
- **7 Employees**: Complete employee profiles with relationships
- **~120 Attendance Records**: Realistic attendance data for the past month
- **3 Leave Requests**: Sample leave requests with different statuses
- **7 Payroll Records**: Salary and benefit information
- **4 Performance Reviews**: Employee performance evaluations

## 🔐 Login Credentials

The seed creates these test accounts:

```
HR Manager: hr.manager@company.com / hr123456
IT Manager: it.manager@company.com / it123456
Sales Manager: sales.manager@company.com / sales123456
John Doe: john.doe@company.com / john123456
Jane Smith: jane.smith@company.com / jane123456
Mike Wilson: mike.wilson@company.com / mike123456
Sarah Jones: sarah.jones@company.com / sarah123456
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Database is ready**: The shared Prisma schema is working correctly
2. **Seed data available**: Full HRM system data is now in the database
3. **Both apps can connect**: Next.js (site) and NestJS (api) can use the shared Prisma client
4. **Development ready**: Start development with `bun run dev`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Missing dependencies**: Run `cd shared && npm install`
2. **Prisma client not generated**: Run `cd shared && npx prisma generate`
3. **Database connection**: Check DATABASE_URL in `.env` files
4. **Migration needed**: Run `cd shared && npx prisma migrate dev`
